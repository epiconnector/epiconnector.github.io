# Welcome!

The goal of the EpiConnector project is to develop and share open source software that enables analysis of complex epidemiological data, with a focus on ease of analysis and reproducible research.

Our initial focus is on the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/) (NHANES), a program of studies conducted by the CDC to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. We hope that the learnings from this project 

## Continuous NHANES

Although the NHANES program began in the early 1960s, our focus is on [continuous NHANES](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/ContinuousNhanes/Default.aspx), which has been conducted on an ongoing basis with public-use data being released in two-year cycles. NHANES uses a complex survey design to obtiain samples representative of the U.S. population. Public use data are made available as separate coded SAS files (currently numbering more than 1500), along with codebooks and documentation in corresponding HTML files. Our primary goal is to make this complex data more easily accessible, along with tools that enable reproducible analysis of the data.
